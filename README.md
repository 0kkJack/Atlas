## ü§î **What is Atlas?**

Atlas is a modification to Windows, which removes nearly all the drawbacks of Windows that negatively affect gaming performance.
Atlas is also a good option to reduce system latency, network latency, and input lag, and keep your system private while focusing on performance.
You can learn more about Atlas on our official [website](https://atlasos.net).

## üëÄ **Why Atlas?**

### üîí Better Privacy
Stock Windows contains tracking services that collect your data and upload it to Microsoft.
Atlas removes all types of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. 

Note that Atlas cannot ensure the security for things outside the scope of Windows (such as browsers and other third-party applications).

### üõ°Ô∏è More Secure (over custom Windows ISOs)
Downloading a modified Windows ISO from the internet is risky. Not only can people easily maliciously change one of the many binary/executable files included in Windows, but it also may not have the latest Windows security patches that can put your computer under serious security risks. 

Atlas also comes with the following optional security features, which other custom Windows OSs strip:
- Windows Security
  - Windows Defender & SmartScreen (optional)
  - Core Isolation (optional)
  - CPU mitigations (optional)
- Windows Updates (manual)

Atlas is different. We use [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io) to install Atlas, and all the scripts we use are open source here in our GitHub repository. You can view the packaged Atlas playbook (`.apbx` - AME Wizard script package) as an archive, with the password being `malte` (the standard for AME Wizard playbooks), which is only to bypass false flags from antiviruses.

The only executables included in the playbook are open-sourced [here](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/utilities) under [GPLv3](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/utilities/blob/main/LICENSE), with the hashes being identical to the releases. Everything else is in plain text.

### ‚úÖ Improved Performance
Some tweaked systems on the internet have tweaked Windows too much, breaking compatibility for main features such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and so on.
Atlas is on the sweet point. It aims at getting more performance while maintaining a good level of compatibility.

Some of the many changes that we have made to improve Windows are listed below:
- Customized power scheme
- Reduced amount of services and drivers
- Disabled audio exclusive
- Disabled unneeded devices
- Disabled power saving (for personal computers)
- Disabled performance-hungry security mitigations
- Automatically enabled MSI mode on all devices
- Optimized boot configuration
- Optimized process scheduling

### üîí Legal
Many custom Windows OSes distribute their systems by providing a tweaked ISO of Windows. Not only does it violate [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm), but it is also not a safe way to install.

Atlas partnered with the Ameliorated team to provide users with a safer and legal way to install, using [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io). With it, Atlas fully complies with [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm).

## üé® Brand kit

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Not pre-activated
AtlasOS is **NOT a pre-activated version of Windows**. You **must** use a valid key to activate Windows. Before buying a Windows 10 (Professional or Home) license, be sure the seller is trustworthy and the key is legitimate‚Äîno matter where you buy it.
