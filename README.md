## 🤔 What is Atlas?
Atlas is an open-source project that enhances Windows by eliminating factors that negatively impact gaming performance. We are an optimal choice for minimizing stutters and input lag, enhancing privacy and usability, all while prioritizing performance and maintaining system security.
  
## 👀 Why Atlas?
### 🔒 Enhanced Privacy
Atlas removes the majority of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. However, it cannot ensure the security for things outside the scope of Windows, such as browsers and other third-party applications.
  
### 🛡️ Increased Security
Unlike custom Windows ISOs, Atlas is safer and easier to audit. It doesn't require a modified ISO download and includes optional security features like Windows Defender, Windows Update, CPU mitigations, and UAC, often stripped in other custom OSs. 

### 🔮 Improved Transparency
Atlas and AME Wizard offer improved transparency compared to ISOs. With AME Wizard's open-source backend and Atlas scripts mostly being plain text in a zip archive, the process is more accessible and easier to review.
  
### ✅ Optimized Performance
Atlas strikes a balance between performance and compatibility. It implements numerous meaningful changes to improve Windows performance without breaking essential features. Atlas don't do placebo, visual, or extreme marginal gains tweaks, making Atlas more stable.
  
### 🔒 Legal Compliance
Atlas partners with the Ameliorated team to provide users with a safer and legal way to install, using [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io). With it, Atlas fully complies with [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm).

### 🌐 Open Source
All scripts used by Atlas are open-sourced in this repository. Executables included in the playbook are open-sourced in our [utilities](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/utilities) repository. 

The packaged Atlas playbook, being an AME Wizard script package (.apbx), can be opened as a .zip archive using the password `malte` without any obfuscation of files, which is the standard for AME Wizard playbooks. This is implemented solely to prevent false positive detections by antivirus software.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Atlas complies with the Windows EULA; activation in Windows is not modified, and no Windows ISOs are redistributed. Currently, a valid legitimate license is required to install Atlas.
