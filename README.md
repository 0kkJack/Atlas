## 🤔 What is Atlas?
Atlas is an open-source project that enhances Windows by eliminating factors that negatively impact gaming performance. It's the perfect choice for reducing system and network latency, and input lag, while maintaining system privacy and prioritizing performance.
  
## 👀 Why Atlas?
### 🔒 Enhanced Privacy
Atlas removes all types of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. However, it cannot ensure the security for things outside the scope of Windows, such as browsers and other third-party applications.
  
### 🛡️ Increased Security
Unlike other custom Windows ISOs, Atlas is safer as it doesn't require downloading a modified Windows ISO from the internet. Atlas also includes optional security features (e.g. Defender, Update) that other custom Windows OSs often strip.
  
### ✅ Optimized Performance
Atlas strikes a balance between performance and compatibility. It implements numerous changes to improve Windows performance without breaking essential features.
  
### 🔒 Legal Compliance
Atlas partners with the Ameliorated team to provide users with a safer and legal way to install, using [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io). With it, Atlas fully complies with [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm).

### 🌐 Open Source
All scripts used by Atlas are open-sourced in this repository. Executables included in the playbook are open-sourced in our [utilities](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/utilities) repository. 

The packaged Atlas playbook (`.apbx` - AME Wizard script package) can be viewed as a .7z archive, with the password `malte` (standard for AME Wizard playbooks). This is solely to bypass false flags from antiviruses.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Atlas complies with the Windows EULA; activation in Windows is not modified. A valid legitimate license is required to install Atlas.

Before you buy a Windows license, make sure the seller is trusted and the license is legitimate, no matter where you buy it.
